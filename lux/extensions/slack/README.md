# Configuration

In order to run slack extension to sends logs to slack's channel of choice,
you need provide in your project setting proper configuration for handler.

Example using dictionary config

```
handlers:
  slack:
    class : lux.extensions.slack.SlackHandler
    level : INFO
    webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/<token_part>
    channel: #project_logs
    username: project_bot
    icon: :thumbup:
    formatter: %(asctime)s: %(message)s
```

**webhook_url, channel, username** are obligatory parameters, where
*icon, formatter* are optional. If not provided they defaults to:

1. icon: None
2. formatter: `[%(levelname)s](%(asctime)s %(name)s): %(message)s`

**!Important** `webhook_url` is generated by slack URL that you need generate
for particular channel you want to use
